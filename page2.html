<p>Stars are the smallest light in the dark, but they’re not as small as they seem. actually, they are massive, far and  larger than what our eyes see from here,some even greater than the Sun itself. They shine from far away, and yet they remain magnificent. Just like you. It doesn't matter if others see that small spot of light they simply don’t know truly you are. But I do. I always do.</p>
