      These three facts always make me look at you and say: you are the star of my life.<br><br>
      I know it might sound strange — like, what’s the connection?<br>
      But let me explain…<br><br>
      When I look deep into your eyes, I see them shining with love.  
      They’ve never lied to me.  
      And babe, believe me, no matter how much time passes on this Earth,  
      I know I’ll always love you —  
      I'll breathe in your stardust, even if we both explode and show the world our true power.<br><br>
      You know how two birds in love sing together,  
      and we call them the birds of love?<br>
      What if we become something new?  
      Let’s be the <strong>stars of love</strong>.  
      That sounds sweet, doesn’t it?
